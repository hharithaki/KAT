Knowledge-based Ad hoc Teamwork

This repository contains implementation files for a hybrid architecture for Ad hoc Teamwork, that combines knowledge-based reasoning with data-driven learning.

There are two folders in the repository: 

1. 'Code': contains an implementation of the architecture.
2. 'Videos': contains videos of experimental runs in the multi-agent benchmark simulation environments.

(This is the extended architecture of our previous project HAAHT)
