| 2v2 | This experiment consists of two offence agents and two defence agents(including a goalkeeper). The proposed 'ad hoc' agent is represented by number 7. A few steps after the game begins, offence agent(11) moves to a corner of the field and refrain from contributing to the game, simulating an unexpected change in team composition. The ad hoc agent immediately reach the ball and start dribbling towards the goal. After a few steps a defence agent reach the ad hoc agent to try and steal the ball. The ad hoc agent identify the risk and pass the ball to the other offence agent. Once it identifies that the other agent is not taking part in the game it immediately approaches the ball and start dribbling it towards the goal. Then with proper timing and positioning the ad hoc agent successfully score a goal.|
